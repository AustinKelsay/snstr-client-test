### **⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (2/7):**
- **Feature 5: Basic Profile System** (30% complete) - Page exists, ProfileHeader/ProfileCard missing
- **Feature 6: Relay Management** (60% complete) - Backend complete, UI placeholder only

### **🚨 PRIORITY NEXT STEPS:**
1. **Create `src/components/post/PostComposer.tsx`** - Critical for post creation
2. **Build profile components** - `ProfileHeader.tsx` and `ProfileCard.tsx`
3. **Connect relay management UI** to existing backend in `relayManager.ts`
