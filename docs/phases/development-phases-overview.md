- Relay network availability and reliability
- shadcn/ui component library updates

### **Resource Requirements:**
- Single developer can complete all phases
- Access to various devices for testing
- Browser extension testing capabilities
- Lightning wallet for zap testing

## Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks:**
- **SNSTR library changes**: Monitor updates and adapt implementation
- **NIP specification updates**: Stay current with protocol changes
- **Browser extension compatibility**: Test with multiple extensions
- **Relay network stability**: Implement fallback strategies

### **Timeline Risks:**
- **Feature scope creep**: Stick to defined phase objectives
- **Quality shortcuts**: Maintain standards even under pressure
- **Testing delays**: Allocate sufficient time for comprehensive testing
- **Deployment complexity**: Prepare infrastructure early

### **User Experience Risks:**
- **Complexity overload**: Maintain focus on core user needs
- **Performance degradation**: Monitor and optimize continuously
- **Accessibility oversights**: Include accessibility in all phases
- **Documentation gaps**: Document features as they're built

## Getting Started

1. **Review all phase documents** in order to understand the complete scope
2. **Set up development environment** following setup-phase.md
3. **Follow phase order strictly** - each builds on the previous
4. **Meet quality gates** before advancing to next phase
5. **Document progress and decisions** throughout development
6. **Test continuously** rather than leaving testing to the end

This phased approach ensures steady progress toward a production-ready Nostr client while maintaining code quality and user experience standards at every stage.
